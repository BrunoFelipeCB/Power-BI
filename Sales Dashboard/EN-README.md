## Considerations and Results:
- Products of the color 'Black' account for approximately 30% of the company's total revenue.
- The best months for revenue are May, July, and November.
- About 65% of the products are targeted towards individuals aged 31 to 50.
- 76% of the revenue comes from cards, either credit or debit.
- Despite the presence of a physical store, all revenue from products actually sold is from the online store.
### Recommendations:
- Understand the reasons for the difficulty in sales at physical stores.
- Focus marketing campaigns on the target audience (31-50 years old).
- Understand why 6 out of the 7 states with the lowest sales are from the Northern region.
- Increase paid traffic in the months of August and October.
- Attempt to launch a product to attract the audience up to 30 years old.

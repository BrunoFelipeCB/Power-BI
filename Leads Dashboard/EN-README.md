## Company business model:
-  Online and offline loan sales. We have a physical store where customers can be served, and we also have a sales team that serves online customers. To attract these customers, we use social media, flyers, referral strategies, as well as paid traffic. Currently, we do not use CRM, but we plan to start soon.
## Purpose of the analysis:
- Enable the manager to monitor the current status of the quality of leads from different marketing strategies. The report will be used to optimize sales through improvements in customer acquisition.

## Required indicators:

- Efficiency rate (number of utilized leads divided by the total number of leads);
- Quantity of invalid leads;
- Quantity of duplicate leads;
- Total sales;
- Revenue;
- Total quantity of leads;
- Invalid leads rate;
- Duplicate leads rate;
- Quantity of leads by acquisition channel;
- Quantity of leads by status;
- Quantity of leads by team;
- Quantity of leads by state;
- Lead acquisition time;
- Investment.

  ## Considerations and results:
-  The team 'Apaixonado por dados' accounts for over 70% of the revenue, with their main 'Canal de Aquisição' (Acquisition Channel) being 'Indicação'(Referral). All other Acquisition Channels have negative ROI, which may be squeezing the company's margin.
-  The 'Seneca' team has the lowest quantity of leads and the highest cost per lead, the lowest average ticket, and the worst revenue."
- The 'Seneca' team has the lowest quantity of leads and the highest cost per lead, the lowest average ticket, and the worst revenue. 
- About 19% of leads are invalid or have registration errors.
- The average ticket and ROI of the company are inflated. If we exclude the Referral Acquisition Channel as an outlier, the company's average ticket is around R$ 215 (66% decrease), and the ROI is around -53% (a 186% decrease), representing critical levels.

### Recommendations:

- Consider the possibility of reducing marketing on some platforms (such as Facebook and Google ADS).
- Hold a meeting with the teams to understand why the 'Apaixonados por Dados' team has such superior results and try to replicate those results in other teams and states.
- Attempt to improve conversion time in physical stores through promotions or customer contacts.

## Business Model of the Company:
-  The company operates in the manufacturing of equipment, utilizing a database that includes crucial information for efficient management of the production process. The process involves assigning order numbers, operator identification, details about the manufactured product, incident records, start and end dates and times, as well as metrics related to the quantity produced and rejected.
## Purpose of the Analysis:
- The purpose of this analysis is to provide managers with a comprehensive view of the equipment production performance, identifying areas for improvement and potential bottlenecks. The Power BI dashboard aims to consolidate crucial data to enhance operational efficiency and the quality of manufactured products.
## Required Indicators:
- Total Quantity of Good Pieces:
- Quantity of Pieces with Defects:
- Efficiency Rate: (Quantity of good pieces / Total pieces produced)
- Productive Hours:
- Hours Without Production:
- Operator with the Highest Defect Percentage in Production:
- Product with the Highest Quantity of Defects in Percentage of Production:
- Quantity Produced per Month:
- Most Frequent Incident:
- Availability: (Productive hours / Worked hours)
- Quantity of Products per Day per Operator:
- Average Time Spent per Operator per Incident:

- Integrated into our business model, we introduce a production-dedicated simulator. Utilizing historical data, particularly Efficiency Rate and Total Production, this feature provides the capability to project future production.
   - In this scenario, we maintain the current production while focusing efforts on enhancing the company's efficiency rate. The strategy aims to refine the utilization of existing resources, optimizing processes to increase the production of good pieces. This approach seeks to elevate quality without increasing demand, targeting efficiency and operational excellence.
   - In the second scenario, we keep the current efficiency rate but aim to expand production. The strategy focuses on meeting a growing demand while maintaining established quality standards. With increased production, we anticipate boosting revenue without compromising efficiency, fostering sustainable growth.

## Considerations and Results:
- The two largest incidents occur in the machine preparation process and in quality control; it is possible that both cases are interconnected.
- In August, the company achieved an efficiency of 99.34%. Maintaining this efficiency for one year would enable the production of an additional 580 products.
- Approximately 60% of incidents related to the product "Home Theater System 4.1 Channel M412 Brown" are associated with quality control.
- Investigate why production in September and October is approximately 50% lower than the peak.

### Recommendations:
- Consider exploring why some products, such as "Zoo Tycoon Marine Mania 2009 E160," have few rejected items compared to others.
- Investigate the reasons behind the high number of incidents in the "Machine Preparation" and strategize on how to reduce them.
- Understand why "Quality Control" has a significant number of incidents.
